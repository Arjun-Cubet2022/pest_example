# Pest Example
PEST TESTING EXAMPLE - LARAVEL

## Laravel Project

This is a Laravel project that includes a `ProductController` with various CRUD operations. The project uses [Pest](https://pestphp.com/) (or PHPUnit) for testing.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up the project and run the tests.

### Prerequisites

- [PHP](https://www.php.net/) (version 7.4 or higher)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) (version 8 or higher)
- A running instance of [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) or another supported database
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Arjun-Cubet2022/pest_example.git
    cd pest_example
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    composer install
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

3. **Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and set your environment variables:**

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4. **Generate an application key:**

    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

5. **Run the database migrations:**

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

### Running Tests

You can run tests using Pest or PHPUnit. Pest is already set up in this project as the default testing framework.

1. **Run all tests:**

    ```bash
    php artisan test
    ```

    This command will run all the tests in the `tests` directory.

2. **Run a specific test:**

    To run a specific test, use the `--filter` option followed by the test class name:

    ```bash
    php artisan test --filter=ProductControllerTest
    ```

3. **Run tests with coverage:**

    To generate a code coverage report, run:

    ```bash
    php artisan test --coverage
    ```

    You can view the generated coverage report in the `coverage` directory.

### Additional Information

- **Testing Database**: Make sure your testing environment is properly configured in the `.env` file (`.env.testing` if using Laravel's environment files). The database should be set up to prevent any conflicts with your development or production environment.

- **Running Specific Test Methods**: To run a specific test method, specify the method name after the class name:

    ```bash
    php artisan test --filter=ProductControllerTest::it_saves_a_new_product
    ```

- **Error Handling**: If you encounter any errors while running the tests, check the following:
  - Ensure your `.env` file is correctly configured.
  - Make sure the database is set up and migrations have been run.
  - Verify that all necessary services (like a database server) are running.
